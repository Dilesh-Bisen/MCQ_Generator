These include chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and LLaMA, text-to-image artificial intelligence image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and DALL-E, and text-to-video AI generators such as Sora.[7][8][9][10] Companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, and Baidu as well as numerous smaller firms have developed generative AI models.[3][11][12]\\n\\nGenerative AI has uses across a wide range of industries, including software development, healthcare, finance, entertainment, customer service,[13] sales and marketing,[14] art, writing,[15] fashion,[16] and product design.[17] However, concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of generative AI such as cybercrime, the use of fake news or deepfakes to deceive or manipulate people, and the mass replacement of human jobs.[18][19] Intellectual property law concerns also exist, around generative models that are trained on and emulate copyrighted works of art.[20]', 'number': 5, 'subject': 'Generative AI', 'tone': 'Simple', 'response_json': '{\"quizzes\": [{\"question_number\": 1, \"question\": \"First generated question here based on {text} and {subject}\", \"options\": [\"A) Option A\", \"B) Option B\", \"C) Option C\", \"D) Option D\"], \"correct_answer\": \"B\", \"difficulty\": \"Medium\", \"explanation\": \"Explanation for the correct answer.\"}, {\"question_number\": 2, \"question\": \"Second generated question here based on {text} and {subject}\", \"options\": [\"A) Option A\", \"B) Option B\", \"C) Option C\", \"D) Option D\"], \"correct_answer\": \"C\", \"difficulty\": \"Hard\", \"explanation\": \"Explanation for the correct answer.\"}]}', 'quiz': '```json\\n{\\n  \"quizzes\": [\\n    {\\n      \"question_number\": 1,\\n      \"question\": \"What is the primary purpose of generative AI?\",\\n      \"options\": [\\n        \"A) To analyze existing data\",\\n        \"B) To create new data based on patterns learned from training data\",\\n        \"C) To perform calculations\",\\n        \"D) To store information\",\\n        \"E) To predict future events\"\\n      ],\\n      \"correct_answer\": \"B\",\\n      \"difficulty\": \"Easy\",\\n      \"explanation\": \"Generative AI systems learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data, enabling them to create new data.\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"question_number\": 2,\\n      \"question\": \"Which of the following is an example of a generative AI model?\",\\n      \"options\": [\\n        \"A) Google Search\",\\n        \"B) ChatGPT\",\\n        \"C) Excel\",\\n        \"D) Photoshop\",\\n        \"E) Microsoft Word\"\\n      ],\\n      \"correct_answer\": \"B\",\\n      \"difficulty\": \"Easy\",\\n      \"explanation\": \"ChatGPT is a well-known example of a generative AI model that can produce text in response to specific prompts.\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"question_number\": 3,\\n      \"question\": \"What type of neural network has significantly contributed to the advancement of generative AI?\",\\n      \"options\": [\\n        \"A) Convolutional Neural Networks\",\\n        \"B) Recurrent Neural Networks\",\\n        \"C) Transformer-based Deep Neural Networks\",\\n        \"D) Feedforward Neural Networks\",\\n        \"E) Autoencoders\"\\n      ],\\n      \"correct_answer\": \"C\",\\n      \"difficulty\": \"Medium\",\\n      \"explanation\": \"Improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks have enabled an AI boom of generative AI systems in the early 2020s.\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"question_number\": 4,\\n      \"question\": \"Which of the following is a text-to-image AI generation system?\",\\n      \"options\": [\\n        \"A) ChatGPT\",\\n        \"B) Stable Diffusion\",\\n        \"C) Copilot\",\\n        \"D) LLaMA\",\\n        \"E) Sora\"\\n      ],\\n      \"correct_answer\": \"B\",\\n      \"difficulty\": \"Medium\",\\n      \"explanation\": \"Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image artificial intelligence image generation system.\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"question_number\": 5,\\n      \"question\": \"What is one of the potential concerns about the use of generative AI?\",\\n      \"options\": [\\n        \"A) Increased job security\",\\n        \"B) Improved data privacy\",\\n        \"C) Cybercrime and the use of deepfakes\",\\n        \"D) Enhanced data storage\",\\n        \"E) Faster internet speeds\"\\n      ],\\n      \"correct_answer\": \"C\",\\n      \"difficulty\": \"Medium\",\\n      \"explanation\": \"Concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of generative AI such as cybercrime and the use of deepfakes to deceive or manipulate people.\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```', 'review': 'The provided quiz on Generative AI is generally well-structured and effectively assesses the knowledge of the respondents.
